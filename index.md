# Modelling & Beyond 🌊📊

Welcome! I'm **Gayan Gunaratne**, a coastal and ocean modeller sharing practical knowledge on:

- Hydrodynamic and ecosystem modelling 
- Sediment transport and water quality modelling
- Aquaculture and discharge modeling
- Scientific computing and Python workflows 
- Data analysis and cloud computing  
- Applied research and reproducible modelling  

This site is built as a living notebook — part blog, part tutorial hub, part research archive.
